### :woman_technologist: About Me

I'm a passionate software engineer with extensive experience in cloud infrastructure, spanning platforms such as Google Cloud (GCP), Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Microsoft Azure. My expertise lies in DevOps and Site Reliability Engineering (SRE), where I focus on building robust, scalable developer platforms.

As a full-stack developer, I'm proficient in Python, Go, TypeScript, Bash, and PHP, consistently delivering solutions across diverse projects. My frontend toolkit includes React, CSS, Tailwind CSS, Sass, Bootstrap, and Material UI, enabling me to craft intuitive and responsive user interfaces.

My background also encompasses substantial experience as a systems administrator, adept at managing Linux-based virtual machines in cloud environments. I'm deeply immersed in container orchestration technologies like Kubernetes and its extensive ecosystem, ensuring seamless container management and deployment.

I leverage advanced automation tools, including Terraform, Ansible, and Pulumi, to streamline infrastructure provisioning, configuration management, and resource deployment, driving efficiency and reliability in software delivery pipelines.
